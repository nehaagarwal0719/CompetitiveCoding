1) Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
   Input: [2,2,1]
   Output: 1


2) A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the
   sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.   

  (Explaination-  A number will not be a Happy Number when it makes a loop in its sequence that is it touches a number in sequence which already been touched. So to check whether a number is happy or not, we can keep a set, if same number occurs again we flag result as not happy.)

3) Max Subarray

4)Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

5) Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:

Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
