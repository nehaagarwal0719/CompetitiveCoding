1) Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
   Input: [2,2,1]
   Output: 1


2) A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the
   sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.   

  (Explaination-  A number will not be a Happy Number when it makes a loop in its sequence that is it touches a number in sequence which already been touched. So to check whether a number is happy or not, we can keep a set, if same number occurs again we flag result as not happy.)
