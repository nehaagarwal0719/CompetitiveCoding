 1)Let  be the number of CITY entries in STATION, and let  be the number of distinct CITY names in STATION; query the value 
  of  from STATION. In other words, find the difference between the total number of CITY entries in the table and the number of distinct CITY entries in the table.

  SELECT count(CITY) - count(distinct CITY) FROM STATION;

2) Query the list of CITY names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain 
   duplicates.

  SELECT DISTINCT city FROM station WHERE city REGEXP "^[aeiou].*";


3)  SELECT DISTINCT city FROM station WHERE city REGEXP ".*[aeiou]$";

    Query the list of CITY names ending with vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.  


4) Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first and last
   characters. Your result cannot contain duplicates. 

   SELECT DISTINCT city FROM station WHERE city REGEXP ".*[aeiou]$" AND city REGEXP  "^[aeiou].*";    


5) Query the Name of any student in STUDENTS who scored higher than  Marks. Order your output by the last three characters of 
   each name. If two or more students both have names ending in the same last three characters (i.e.: Bobby, Robby, etc.), secondary sort them by ascending ID. 


  SELECT NAME FROM STUDENTS WHERE MARKS > 75 ORDER BY RIGHT(NAME, 3), ID ASC;   


6)Write a query that prints a list of employee names (i.e.: the name attribute) for employees in Employee having a salary  
  greater than  per month who have been employees for less than  months. Sort your result by ascending employee_id.

   SELECT name from Employee WHERE salary>2000 AND months<10 ORDER BY employee_id ASC;  

7) Query all columns for all American cities in CITY with populations larger than 100000. The CountryCode for America is USA.

  SELECT * FROM CITY WHERE COUNTRYCODE = 'USA' AND POPULATION>100000;   

8)Query the total population of all cities in CITY where District is California.

 SELECT SUM(POPULATION) FROM CITY WHERE DISTRICT= "California";


9) Query the average population for all cities in CITY, rounded down to the nearest intege

  SELECT ROUND(AVG(POPULATION)) FROM CITY;  


10) Query the sum of the populations for all Japanese cities in CITY. The COUNTRYCODE for Japan is JPN.

  SELECT SUM(POPULATION) FROM CITY WHERE COUNTRYCODE="JPN";  


11)Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE CITY REGEXP  "^[^aeiou]";  

Putting a ^ inside the closed bracket means something completely different than putting it outside the brackets. Putting it inside the brackets makes it match all characters EXCEPT the ones inside the bracket.


12) Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates. 

 SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE CITY REGEXP '[^aiueo]$';


 13) Query the difference between the maximum and minimum populations in CITY.

   SELECT MAX(POPULATION) - MIN(POPULATION) FROM CITY;


14) Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table, but did not
 realize her keyboard's  key was broken until after completing the calculation. She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries with any zeroes removed), and the actual average salary.

   SELECT CEIL(AVG(Salary)-AVG(REPLACE(Salary,'0',''))) FROM EMPLOYEES;   


## 15) Given the CITY and COUNTRY tables, query the sum of the populations of all cities where the CONTINENT is 'Asia'.
       Note: CITY.CountryCode and COUNTRY.Code are matching key columns.


	   SELECT SUM(CITY.POPULATION) 
	   FROM CITY, COUNTRY
	   WHERE CITY.COUNTRYCODE = COUNTRY.CODE AND COUNTRY.CONTINENT = 'Asia';   

16) Given the CITY and COUNTRY tables, query the names of all cities where the CONTINENT is 'Africa'.
Note: CITY.CountryCode and COUNTRY.Code are matching key columns.


    SELECT CITY.NAME FROM CITY,COUNTRY WHERE COUNTRY.CODE=CITY.COUNTRYCODE AND COUNTRY.CONTINENT='Africa'; 

17) Given the CITY and COUNTRY tables, query the names of all the continents (COUNTRY.Continent) and their respective average city populations (CITY.Population) rounded down to the nearest integer.
    
SELECT COUNTRY.CONTINENT, FLOOR(AVG(CITY.POPULATION)) FROM CITY, COUNTRY WHERE  CITY.COUNTRYCODE=COUNTRY.CODE GROUP BY COUNTRY.CONTINENT;
