 1)Let  be the number of CITY entries in STATION, and let  be the number of distinct CITY names in STATION; query the value 
  of  from STATION. In other words, find the difference between the total number of CITY entries in the table and the number of distinct CITY entries in the table.

  SELECT count(CITY) - count(distinct CITY) FROM STATION;

2) Query the list of CITY names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain 
   duplicates.

  SELECT DISTINCT city FROM station WHERE city REGEXP "^[aeiou].*";


3)  SELECT DISTINCT city FROM station WHERE city REGEXP ".*[aeiou]$";

    Query the list of CITY names ending with vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.  


4) Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first and last
   characters. Your result cannot contain duplicates. 

   SELECT DISTINCT city FROM station WHERE city REGEXP ".*[aeiou]$" AND city REGEXP  "^[aeiou].*";
