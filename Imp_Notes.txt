Bitwise operations help us in a lot of problems. We can find the non-repeating element in an array, find number of set-bits, do division, find subsets and so on. Indeed, we can see that learning to cleverly use bitwise operations is vital to any programmer.


xor o with x=x and xor of same nos =0. To find the no repeated odd times 

XOR has certain properties
Assume a1 ^ a2 ^ a3 ^ …^ an = a and a1 ^ a2 ^ a3 ^ …^ an-1 = b -- to find the missing no
Then a ^ b = an

postfix expressions are evaluated fatser since they dont require paranthesis

 Collections.sort(list, Collections.reverseOrder());  --- to sort the list in reverse order


Stream does not store elements. It simply conveys elements from a source such as a data structure, an array, or an I/O channel, through a pipeline of computational operations.
