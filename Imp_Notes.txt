Bitwise operations help us in a lot of problems. We can find the non-repeating element in an array, find number of set-bits, do division, find subsets and so on. Indeed, we can see that learning to cleverly use bitwise operations is vital to any programmer.

postfix expressions are evaluated fatser since they dont require paranthesis
