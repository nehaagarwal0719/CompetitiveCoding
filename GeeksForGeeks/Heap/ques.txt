1) Height of Heap 

2) Given a binary tree you need to check if it follows max heap property or not.

3) Given an array of N positive integers, print k largest elements from the array.  The output elements should be printed in decreasing order

4) kth largest element

5) sort a k sorted array | nearly sorted algorithm 
   Given an array of n elements, where each element is at most k away from its target position. The task is to print array in sorted form

 ## 6)    Kth largest element in a stream
         2
4 6
1 2 3 4 5 6
1 2
3 4

Output:
-1 -1 -1 1 2 3
3 4 

7) Find K Closest Elements
   https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-closest-elements/
   Given a sorted array arr, two integers k and x, find the k closest elements to x in the array. The result should also be sorted in ascending order. If there is a tie, the smaller elements are always preferred.
