4) Phone directory 
  Given a list of contacts which exist in a phone directory and a query string str. The task is to implement search query for the phone directory. Run a search query for each prefix p of the query string str(i.e from  index 1 to str length) that prints all the distinct recommended contacts which have the same prefix as our query (p) in lexicographical order.
