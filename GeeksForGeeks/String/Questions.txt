2) Count CamelCase

3) Substring

4) Isogram

5) Pappu is confused between 6 & 9 . He works in billing department of abc company and his work is to return the remaining 
   amount to the customers. 
   If actual remaining amount is given we need to find the maximum possible extra amount given by the pappu to the customers.
   For ex:- actual remaining amount = 56
   so, maximum possible extra amount =  (59 - 56 ) = 3

   
6) Sort string

7) Minimum changes to make all substrings distinct

 # 8) Find first repeated character
 
9) Given a string of digits 0 – 9. The task is to count number of substrings which when convert into integer form an even    
   number.


10) "0" stands for "no goal".
	"1" stands for "goal".
	"2" stands for a foul which gives Ishaan a penalty.
	Note : You need to count only those goals which are scored on a penalty.   


11) Given a string - "str", find the repeated character present first in the string.

12) Rock Paper Scissors

13) Remove all duplicates from a given string.

14) Find largest word in dictionary
    Input : dict = {"ale", "apple", "monkey", "plea"}   
        str = "abpcplea"  
    Output : app

15) The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases . Next line of input contains a positive  
	number N denoting the number of pens Kiran buys for Akash and the next line of input contains the string sequence of N pen colours-R for 'Red' and 'G' for 'green'.    
	Example:
	Input :
	1
	5
	RGRGR
	Output:
	2

16) Given a string check if it is Pangram or not. A pangram is a sentence containing every letter in the English Alphabet.

17) Given a string str and another string patt. Find the character in patt that is present at the minimum index in str. If no character of patt is present in str then print ‘No character present’.

18) Anagrams in java

## 19) Remove “b” and “ac” from a given string

## 20) Given a String of length S, reverse the whole string without reversing the individual words in it. Words are separated by dots.
(Use split("\\.") instead of just split(".")
The reason being that split function takes a regular expression in which dot means 'any' character. If we wish to split the string at a literal '.', we must specify it with "\\".)

21) Given three strings ‘str’, ‘oldW’ and ‘newW’. The task is find all occurrences of the word ‘oldW’ and replace then with word ‘newW’.

22) Check if palindromic ignoring spaces
   s=s.replaceAll("\\s", "");

23) Given a string containing uppercase alphabets and integer digits (from 0 to 9), the task is to print the alphabets in the order followed by the sum of digits.

24) Distinct Substrings

25) Given two strings, the task is to check whether these strings are meta strings or not. Meta strings are the strings which can be made equal by exactly one swap in any of the strings. Equal string are not considered here as Meta strings.

## 26) Given a binary string S. The task is to count the number of substrings that starts and end with 1. For example, if the input string is “00100101”, then there are three substrings “1001”, “100101” and “101”.

27) given an array of words, print the count of all anagrams together in sorted order (increasing order of counts).
For example, if the given array is {“cat”, “dog”, “tac”, “god”, “act”}, then grouped anagrams are “(dog, god) (cat, tac, act)”. So the output will be 2 3.

## 28) Given a string, your task is to reverse the vowels of string.

29) Non Repeating Character

30) Given a string str and another string patt. Find the character in patt that is present at the minimum index in str. If no character of patt is present in str then print ‘No character present’.

## 31) Given an array of names (consisting of lowercase characters) of candidates in an election. A candidate name in array represents a vote casted to the candidate. Print the name of candidate that received Max votes. If there is tie, print lexicographically smaller name.

32) Given a string without spaces, a character, and a count, the task is to print the string after the specified character has occurred count number of times.
Print “Empty string” incase of any unsatisfying conditions.
(Given character is not present, or present but less than given count, or given count completes on last index).
If given count is 0, then given character doesn’t matter, just print the whole string.

 33) Given a string consisting of spaces,\t,\n and lower case  alphabets.Your task is to count the number of words where spaces,\t and \n work as separators.

 34) Given an array of names (consisting of lowercase characters) of candidates in an election. A candidate name in array represents a vote casted to the candidate. Print the name of candidate that received Max votes. If there is tie, print lexicographically smaller name.

### 35)Given a pattern as below and an integer n your task is to decode it and print nth row of it. The pattern follows as :
1
11
21
1211
111221
......

36) Given a sequence of strings, the task is to find out the second most repeated (or frequent) string in the given sequence.

37) You are given a string that is made up of words separated by spaces. Your task is to find the word with highest frequency, i.e. it appears maximum times in the sentence. If multiple words have maximum frequency, then print the word that occurs first in the sentence.

38) Given a string S, containing special characters and all the alphabets, reverse the string without
affecting the positions of the special characters.

39)  Given two string 'str1' and 'str2', check if two given strings are isomorphic to each other. Two strings str1 and str2 are called isomorphic if there is a one to one mapping possible for every character of str1 to every character of str2. And all occurrences of every character in ‘str1′ map to same character in ‘str2′.

40) common subsequence

41) Permutations of a given string sorted in lexicographical order

42) Maximum number of characters between any two same character

43) Given an array of names of candidates in an election. A candidate name in array represents a vote casted to the candidate. The task is to print the name of candidates received maximum vote. If there is tie, print lexicographically smaller name.

44) Given a string of both uppercase and lowercase alphabets, the task is to print the string with alternate occurrences of any character dropped(including space and consider upper and lowercase as same).

45) You will be given N number of strings. You have to find the lexicographically smallest string and the lexicographically largest string among these strings.

46) You are given an array A of N integers. You need to make all the elements of the array even. 
Now, to make an element even, you can add 1 to any element of the array. Also, when any element of the array is converted to even, any neighbouring element which is odd, can also be made even without adding 1 yourself.

47) Ishaan's friend, Charul, gave a challenge to Ishaan. He gave a series to Ishaan and asked him to find the Nth term of that series.
Ishaan is very weak at solving series, so he needs your help. Help him find the Nth term of the following series :
N    Nth term
1    0
2    1
3    0
4    2
