21) Write a function that returns true if the given Binary Tree of size N is SumTree else return false. A SumTree is a Binary Tree in which value of each node x is equal to sum of nodes present in its left subtree and right subtree . An empty tree is SumTree and sum of an empty tree can be considered as 0. A leaf node is also considered as SumTree.

22) Transform to sum tree
    Given a Binary Tree of size N , where each node has positive and negative values. Convert this to a tree where each node contains the sum of the left and right sub trees in the original tree. The values of leaf nodes are changed to 0.

23) Max Level Sum in Binary Tree 

24) check if binart tree is full binary tree
