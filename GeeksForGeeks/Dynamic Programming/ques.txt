1) Kadane's Algo

2) Consider a game where a player can score 3 or 5 or 10 points in a move. Given a total score n, find number of distinct combinations to reach the given score.

3) Given a number N, print the first N fibonacci numbers.

4) 0-1 knapsack

5) subset sum problem and equal partition problem
  Given a set of numbers, check whether it can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is same or not.

 6) Given an array, the task is to divide it into two sets S1 and S2 such that the absolute difference between their sums is minimum. 

 7) Unbounded knapsack

 8) Given a rod of length n inches and an array of prices that contains prices of all pieces of size smaller than n. Determine the maximum value obtainable by cutting up the rod and selling the pieces.

 9) coin change problem 
 Given a value N, find the number of ways to make change for N cents, if we have infinite supply of each of S = { S1, S2, .. , Sm} valued coins. The order of coins doesn’t matter. For example, for N = 4 and S = {1,2,3}, there are four solutions: {1,1,1,1},{1,1,2},{2,2},{1,3}. So output should be 4. For N = 10 and S = {2, 5, 3, 6}, there are five solutions: {2,2,2,2,2}, {2,2,3,3}, {2,2,6}, {2,3,5} and {5,5}. So the output should be 5.

 10) Longest Common Subsequence

 11) Longest Common Substring

 12) SHORTEST COMMON SUPERSEQUENCE

 Given two strings str1 and str2, find the length of the smallest string which has both, str1 and str2 as its sub-sequences.
Note: str1 and str2 can have both uppercase and lowercase lett


13) Minimum number of deletions and insertions.

Given two strings ‘str1’ and ‘str2’ of size m and n respectively. The task is to remove/delete and insert minimum number of characters from/in str1 so as to transform it into str2. It could be possible that the same character needs to be removed/deleted from one point of str1 and inserted to some another point.
