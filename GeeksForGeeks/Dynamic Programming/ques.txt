 1) Kadane's Algo

2) Consider a game where a player can score 3 or 5 or 10 points in a move. Given a total score n, find number of distinct combinations to reach the given score.

3) Given a number N, print the first N fibonacci numbers.

4) 0-1 knapsack

5) subset sum problem and equal partition problem
  Given a set of numbers, check whether it can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is same or not.

 6) Given an array, the task is to divide it into two sets S1 and S2 such that the absolute difference between their sums is minimum. 

 ##### 6a)  Target sum (very imp)
6b) Stickler the thief wants to loot money from a society having n houses in a single line. He is a weird person and follows a certain rule when looting the houses. According to the rule, he will never loot two consecutive houses. At the same time, he wants to maximize the amount he loots. The thief knows which house has what amount of money but is unable to come up with an optimal looting strategy. He asks for your help to find the maximum money he can get if he strictly follows the rule. Each house has a[i] amount of money present in  

 7) Unbounded knapsack

 8) Given a rod of length n inches and an array of prices that contains prices of all pieces of size smaller than n. Determine the maximum value obtainable by cutting up the rod and selling the pieces.

 9) a) coin change problem 
 Given a value N, find the number of ways to make change for N cents, if we have infinite supply of each of S = { S1, S2, .. , Sm} valued coins. The order of coins doesn’t matter. For example, for N = 4 and S = {1,2,3}, there are four solutions: {1,1,1,1},{1,1,2},{2,2},{1,3}. So output should be 4. For N = 10 and S = {2, 5, 3, 6}, there are five solutions: {2,2,2,2,2}, {2,2,3,3}, {2,2,6}, {2,3,5} and {5,5}. So the output should be 5.

b) COIN CHANGE PROBLEM 2
 Given a value V. You have to make change for V cents, given that you have infinite supply of each of C{ C1, C2, .. , Cm} valued coins. Find the minimum number of coins to make the change.


 10) Longest Common Subsequence

 11) Longest Common Substring

 12) SHORTEST COMMON SUPERSEQUENCE

 Given two strings str1 and str2, find the length of the smallest string which has both, str1 and str2 as its sub-sequences.
Note: str1 and str2 can have both uppercase and lowercase lett


13) Minimum number of deletions and insertions.

Given two strings ‘str1’ and ‘str2’ of size m and n respectively. The task is to remove/delete and insert minimum number of characters from/in str1 so as to transform it into str2. It could be possible that the same character needs to be removed/deleted from one point of str1 and inserted to some another point.

14) longest palindromic subsequence

15) min deletion to make plaindrome
Given a string of S as input. Your task is to write a program to remove or delete minimum number of characters from the string so that the resultant string is palindrome.

Note: The order of characters in the string should be maintained.

16) printing shortest common supersequence

17) Longest Repeating Subsequence

  Given a string str, find length of the longest repeating subseequence such that the two subsequence don’t have same string character at same position, i.e., any i’th character in the two subsequences shouldn’t have the same index in the original string.


18) Given a string, find the minimum number of characters to be inserted to convert it to palindrome.  

19) Longest Palindromic Subsequence

20) Increasing Sub Sequence 
  Given a string which includes characters a, b, c, ..., z. Where value of a=1, b=2, ..., z=26. Now find the largest increasing sub sequence in the string and print it's length.



22) Find number of times a string occurs as a subsequence
