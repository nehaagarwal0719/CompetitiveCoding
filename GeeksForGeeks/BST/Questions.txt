1) Insertion in BST

2) search a node in BST

### 3) Delete a node in BST

4) Min value in a BST


5) sum of leaf nodes in BST



6) print BST Nodes within a range

7) Count BST nodes that lie in a given range


8) Sorted array to BST

9) Normal BST to Balanced BST
  Given a Binary Search Tree of size N, that may be unbalanced. Your task is to complete the function buildBalancedTree(), that convert the given BST into a balanced BST that has minimum possible height. 


10) Binary Tree to BST  


11) Inorder succesor of a BST


12) Inorder Traversal and BST ( don't forget to put equal to)


13) print common nodes in BST


##14) Check if is BST or not

##15)Root to Leaf Paths 

## 16) Find inorder successor and inorder predecessor

17) construct BST from prerder traversal

18) kth largest element from BST

19) kth smallest element in BST ( for both these ques ans will not come if you take these global variables as func params)

20) Lowest common ancestor in bst
20A) pth common ancestor in BST

21) min differece node/ Find the closest element in BST

22) add all node values greater than k

##23) Merge two BST 's

##24) Given an array arr of size n, write a program that prints 1 if given array can represent preorder traversal of a BST, else prints 0.

### 25) 
Two of the nodes of a Binary Search Tree (BST) are swapped. Fix (or correct) the BST by swapping them back. Do not change the structure of the tree.


26) Given an integer N, how many structurally unique binary search trees are there that store values 1...N?


51) INSERTION IN AVL TREE

52) DELETION IN AVL TREE
