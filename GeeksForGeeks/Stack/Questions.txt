1) Implement Stack using Linked List

2) Implement stack using array

3) Immediate Smaller Element. Given an integer array of size N. For each element in the array, check whether the right  adjacent element (on the next immediate position) of the array is smaller. If next element is smaller, print that element. If not, then print -1.

Don't print but append in a string to reduce time complexity.


4) stack operations

5) reverse a string using stack

## 6) delete middle of linked list

7) Sort a stack (iterative)

8) Bracket Number Given an expression exp of length n consisting of some brackets. The task is to print the bracket numbers when the expression is being parsed.

## 9) Your task is to implement  2 stacks in one array efficiently 

## 10) Given a string S consisting only of opening and closing parenthesis 'ie '('  and ')', find out the length of the longest valid substring.

11) An encoded string (s) is given, the task is to decode it. The pattern in which the strings were encoded were as follows
original string: abbbababbbababbbab 
encoded string : "3[a3[b]1[ab]]".


12) Stack using two queues
