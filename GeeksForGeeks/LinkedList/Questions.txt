1) count the nodes

2) #Get the middle node

3) Delete Alternate nodes

4) length of the linked list is even or odd

5) Identical Linked Lists

6) print list

# 7) insert at beg and end (rem to take temp while traversing for insertion in end to prevent null pointer exception)

8) nth node

9) Given a Matrix mat of N*N size, the task is to complete the function constructLinkedMatrix(), that constructs a 2D linked 
   list representation of the given matrix.

10) Given a singly linked list and a key, count number of occurrences of given key in linked list. For example, if given 
    linked list is 1->2->1->2->1->3->1 and given key is 1, then output should be 4.

11) Delete the middle element of the linked list.
