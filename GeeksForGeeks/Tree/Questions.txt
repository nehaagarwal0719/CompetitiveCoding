1) size of the tree i.e total no of nodes

#2) Count leaves

3) sum of all nodes

4) sum of all leaf nodes

5) inorder traversal

6) postorder traversal

7) preorder traversal

8) count non leaf nodes

9) mirror of a tree

10) get level difference

11) k distance from the root

# 12) min depth 










## 17) Level Order Traversal to BST





## 20) same tree ( since it is boolean you have to use && in between)

## 21) Given a binary tree, return the tilt of the whole tree.
       The tilt of a tree node is defined as the absolute difference between the sum of all left subtree node values and the sum of all right subtree node values. Null node has tilt 0.

## 22) diameter of a binary tree

##b 23) Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
   Given a non-empty binary tree, find the maximum path sum.

For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.

#### 24) Given a binary tree in which each node element contains a number. Find the maximum possible sum from one leaf node to another.
