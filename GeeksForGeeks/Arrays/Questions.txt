1) Replace all 0's with 5

2)Given an array A[]  of n elements. Your task is to complete the Function num which returns an integer denoting the total   number of times digit k appears in the whole array.

3) Given an ArrayList of N lowercase characters. The task is to count frequency of elements in the list.

4)Given an array of size N consisting of only 0's and 1's ,which is sorted in such a manner that all the 1's are placed first and then they are followed by all the 0's. You have to find  the count of all the 0's.

## 5) Find the element that appears once in sorted array

6) binary search

7) Find minimum and maximum element in an array

8) Given an array of penalties P, an array of car numbers C, and also the date D. The task is to find the total fine which will be collected on the given date. Fine is collected from odd-numbered cars on even dates and vice versa.

9) You are given a sorted array containing only numbers 0 and 1. Find the transition point efficiently. Transition point is a point where "0" ends and "1" begins.
Note that, if there is no "1" exists, print -1.

10) Given an array of even size, task is to find minimum value that can be added to an element so that array become balanced. An array is balanced if the sum of the left half of the array elements is equal to the sum of right half.


 ## 12)Find the first non-repeating element in a given array A of N integers.
Note: Array consists of only positive and negative integers and not zero.

#13) Given an array A of positive integers. Push all the zero’s of a given array to the end of the array.

14) As we know, Ishaan has a love for chocolates. He has bought a huge chocolate bar which contains N chocolate squares. Each of the square has a tastiness level which is denoted by an array A[].
Ishaan can eat the first or the last square of the chocolate at once. Ishaan has a sister who loves chocolates too and she demands the last chocolate square. Now, Ishaan being greedy eats the more tasty square first. 
Determine the tastiness level of the square which his sister gets.

15) Given an array of N distinct elements, the task is to find all elements in array except two greatest elements.


16) Check if an array is sorted

## 17)Given an array of integers, and an integer  ‘K’ , find the count of pairs of elements in the array whose sum is equal to 'K'.


## 18) Max Sum Subarray of size K (Sliding window method)

21)Given an array of integers (A[])  and a number x, find the smallest subarray with sum greater than the given value.

22) Monu lives in a society which is having high rise buildings. This is the time of sunrise and monu wants see the buildings receiving the sunlight. Help him in counting the number of buildings recieving the sunlight.
Given an array H representing heights of buildings. You have to count the buildings which will see the sunrise (Assume : Sun rise on the side of array starting point).

## 23) Given two sorted arrays. There is only 1 difference between the arrays. First array has one element extra added in between. Find the index of the extra element

24) peak element- Given an array A of N integers. The task is to find a peak element in it in O( log N ) .
An array element is peak if it is not smaller than its neighbours. For corner elements, we need to consider only one neighbour.
Note: There may be multiple peak element possible, in that case you may return any valid index.

25) Given an unsorted array of size N of positive integers. One number 'A' from set {1, 2, …N} is missing and one number 'B' occurs twice in array. Find these two numbers.Input:
2
2
2 2
3 
1 3 3

Output:
2 1
3 2


26) Given an array of size N consisting of only 0's and 1's ,which is sorted in such a manner that all the 1's are placed first and then they are followed by all the 0's. You have to find  the count of all the 0's.

27) You are given an array A of size N. Replace every element with the next greatest element (greatest element on its right side) in the array. Also, since there is no element next to the last element, replace it with -1.

28) Given an array with all elements greater than or equal to zero. Return the maximum product of two numbers possible.

29) n a given array A[] find the maximum value of (A[i] – i) - (A[j] – j) where i is not equal to j. 
    i and j vary from 0 to n-1 and N is size of input array A[].  Value of N is always greater than 1.
