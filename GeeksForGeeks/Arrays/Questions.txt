Given an array H representing heights of buildings. You have to count the buildings which will see the sunrise (Assume : Sun rise on the side of array starting point).

## 23) Given two sorted arrays. There is only 1 difference between the arrays. First array has one element extra added in between. Find the index of the extra element

24) peak element- Given an array A of N integers. The task is to find a peak element in it in O( log N ) .
An array element is peak if it is not smaller than its neighbours. For corner elements, we need to consider only one neighbour.
Note: There may be multiple peak element possible, in that case you may return any valid index.

3 
1 3 3

Output:
2 1
3 2

27) You are given an array A of size N. Replace every element with the next greatest element (greatest element on its right side) in the array. Also, since there is no element next to the last element, replace it with -1.

28) Given an array with all elements greater than or equal to zero. Return the maximum product of two numbers possible.

29) n a given array A[] find the maximum value of (A[i] – i) - (A[j] – j) where i is not equal to j. 
    i and j vary from 0 to n-1 and N is size of input array A[].  Value of N is always greater than 1.

35) Rahul is a geek he loves to play with array. He was very much bored so he asked you to solve array by selecting a pair of adjacent integers and remove the larger one of these two. This decreases the array size by 1. Cost of this operation will be equal to the smaller of them. Your task is to find out minimum sum of costs of operations needed to convert the array into a single element.
